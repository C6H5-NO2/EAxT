# Order Meal
I made this application during Senior One, enabling my classmates to order meal on mobile phones. 

However, I was so *naive* then that I have written dozens of lines of code against the specifications.
Not to mention naming variables with Chinese Pinyin, 
I used several out-of-date methods to handle HTTP connections and ListView, which led to confusing and inefficient program.
Besides, due to low API version, the UI was 
> extremely disgusting.

When I finally come to realize these problems, I have already become a Senior Three, sparing no effort to prepare for the College Entrance Exam. Recently a friend of mine said that he was interested in this project, so I upload the source code to Github.

Anyway, it's really poorly written, please blame.
